- ✅ **Implemented** — built and verified in the current codebase
- 🟡 **Partial** — foundations exist; listed sub-features are missing
- ⬜ **Planned** — not started; on the roadmap

---

## 1. Vision & goals

Build a **modern, scalable, secure, user-friendly** ERP that runs the day-to-day
operations of both **schools and colleges**, from a single backend that serves a
web admin app, a mobile app, and (later) self-service portals for parents and
students.

**Product goals**

1. **One system, many institutions** — multi-tenant from the data model up, so a
   group can run many campuses/branches under one deployment.
2. **Configurable for school *and* college** — terms vs. semesters, classes vs.
   departments/courses, the same engine adapts via configuration, not forks.
3. **Premium, simple UX** — soft-3D dashboard cards, clear menus, search,
   filters, export and print. Usable by non-technical office staff.
4. **Secure by default** — JWT auth, RBAC + permissions, rate limiting, input
   validation, audit logs, secure uploads, HTTPS-ready.
5. **AI-native** — GPT-4o assistant grounded in live data, plus embeddings-based
   document search and proactive risk alerts.
6. **API-first** — every feature is a documented REST endpoint (Swagger) reused
   identically by web and mobile.

**Non-goals (v1)**

- Public marketing website / CMS.
- Storing card/bank/UPI data — we ship a pluggable **hosted-checkout** payment
  adapter (✅ Online Fee Gateway), never a PCI cardholder vault: sensitive payment
  data lives with the provider; we keep only non-sensitive order/payment refs.
- Learning-management depth (SCORM, proctored online exams). Homework and study
  materials are in scope; a full LMS is not.

## 2. Personas & target users

| Persona | What they need | Primary surface |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Super Admin** | Create institutions, branches, packages; global settings, backups, audit | Web (super-admin) |
| **Institution Admin / Principal** | Run a campus: academics, staff, students, fees, reports | Web |
| **Vice Principal** | Academic oversight, approvals, reports | Web |
| **Accountant** | Fee structures, invoices, payments, receipts, dues reports | Web |
| **Office Staff** | Admissions, records, certificates, day-to-day data entry | Web |
| **Teacher** | Attendance, marks, homework, timetable, communication | Web + Mobile |
| **HR / Payroll Staff** | Staff records, leave, payroll, payslips | Web |
| **Librarian** | Catalogue, issue/return, fines, stock | Web |
| **Transport Manager** | Vehicles, drivers, routes, allocations | Web |
| **Hostel Warden** | Rooms, allocations, occupancy, hostel fees | Web |
| **Parent** | Child's attendance, marks, fees, homework, notices, messaging | Mobile + Web portal |
| **Student** | Own timetable, attendance, results, homework, materials, fees | Mobile + Web portal |

> **Today:** the platform models 5 roles (`admin`, `teacher`, `accountant`,
> `student`, `parent`). The remaining 8 roles in the matrix are delivered by
> expanding the role/permission system — see
> [`ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`](./ROLES_AND_PERMISSIONS.md).

## 3. Scope: school vs. college configurability

The platform supports both via an **institution `type` + academic-term model**:

| Concept | School mode | College mode |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Top academic unit | Class (e.g. Grade 10) | Department → Course/Program |
| Cohort grouping | Section | Section / Batch |
| Time division | Academic year → Terms | Academic year → Semesters |
| Curriculum unit | Subject | Subject / Paper (per semester) |
| Promotion | Grade level → next | Semester progression |

> **Today:** the academic model (`academic_years`, `classes`, `sections`,
> `subjects`, `class_subjects`) covers **school mode**. College mode (✅ Phase B,
> migration `0023`) adds `departments`, `programs/courses`, `semesters`,
> `batches`, `program_subjects` (with credits), `enrollments`, and
> `staff_allocations` — the same students/exams/fees engines reuse them, and an
> institution switches modes via its `type`.

## 4. Functional modules (the 20)

Each module below lists its **purpose**, **key capabilities**, **status**, and
the **phase** it lands in (see [`DEV_ROADMAP.md`](./DEV_ROADMAP.md)). Detailed
flows are in [`MODULE_WORKFLOWS.md`](./MODULE_WORKFLOWS.md).

### 4.1 Super Admin Panel — ✅ Built (Phase A + hardening)
- ✅ `super_admin` role; institution & branch/campus CRUD; subscription
  **package** management and per-institution **subscriptions** — backend
  (`/api/v1/institutions|branches|packages`, migration `0011`) **and** a
  dedicated Super Admin **web console** (`/super-admin`).
- ✅ Full tenant data isolation: `institution_id` is enforced (`NOT NULL`) and
  every module scopes its queries to the caller's institution (`requireTenant`
  middleware), proven by cross-tenant integration tests.
- ✅ **Hardening** (`/api/v1/admin/*`, migration `0030`, super-admin-only):
  global institution **settings** (name/type/status/contact + per-institution
  **enabled modules & feature flags** in `settings`), **plan feature-limit**
  enforcement (max students/staff, enforced on create) + usage view, a global
  **audit-log viewer** (reads the Mongo audit trail, filterable, CSV export,
  degrades gracefully), safe **data-export** (counts + metadata only — no
  secrets) with history, a read-only **cross-tenant snapshot** ("switch"), and a
  **system-health** summary.
- ✅ **Platform Hardening** (`/api/v1/platform/*`, migration `0039`,
  `platform:*`, super-admin-only): a consolidated, permission-gated platform
  surface — **platform-wide KPIs** (active/suspended institutions, students/staff/
  users, fees outstanding, online-payment + storage usage, module adoption),
  **institution lifecycle** (create / update / **suspend** / **activate** / assign
  subscription / set per-institution limits), a **durable cross-tenant audit
  trail** (`platform_audit_log`) with a read-only filterable viewer recording every
  platform action, and **support impersonation** (audited, scoped token, refuses
  super admins, never returns secrets/payment data). Tenant users are denied;
  cross-tenant data is reachable **only** through these super-admin endpoints.
- ✅ **Global user-role management (RBAC console)** (`/api/v1/platform/permissions|roles`,
  `platform:rbac_*`/`platform:permissions_*`, super-admin only): view the permission
  **catalogue** (grouped by module, with the roles holding each) and the
  **role→permission matrix**, and **grant/revoke** permissions per role. Each change
  invalidates the runtime permission cache (applies immediately) and is recorded in
  the durable platform audit log. Invalid permissions rejected, duplicate grants
  idempotent, and **super_admin's critical `platform:*` access cannot be revoked**.
- ⬜ Scheduled backup/restore automation.

### 4.2 School / College Admin Panel — 🟡 Partial
Dashboard ✅; academic-year/class/section/subject setup ✅; **department,
program/course, semester, enrollment & staff-allocation setup ✅ (college mode)**;
staff management 🟡; student management 🟡; parent
management ⬜; fee structure setup ✅; transport/hostel/exam setup 🟡/⬜;
reports 🟡.

### 4.3 Student Management — 🟡 Partial
- ✅ Admission (create) with auto admission numbers, profile, status lifecycle
  (active/inactive/graduated/transferred), section assignment, guardian fields,
  and **soft-delete** (archive) that preserves attendance/fee history.
- ✅ **Transfer-certificate (TC) generation** (`/transfer-certificates`,
  `transfer_certificates:*`): register with atomic sequence-based TC numbers,
  draft→issued→cancelled lifecycle, pre-issue **dues check** (fees/library/
  transport/hostel) with permission-gated **override**, **TC PDF** (watermarked
  when cancelled, owner-scoped portal download), the `transferred` student
  lifecycle (data retained), and 4 TC reports.
- ✅ **Disciplinary records** (Phase D, `disciplinary:*`): a behavioural **incident
  register** (category, severity low→critical, description, reported-by, involved
  staff, follow-up) with a status lifecycle (open → under_review → action_taken →
  closed, or cancelled), an **audit-friendly action timeline**, and 6 reports.
  Class/section or program/semester snapshotted at creation. **Portal visibility
  is OFF by default** — students/parents read their own / linked child's records
  only when an admin enables it and they hold `disciplinary:portal_read`
  (owner-scoped); staff access is permission-based and records never leak to
  unauthorised users.
- ✅ Document upload (Documents module), ID-card details (ID Cards).
  Attendance/fees/exam links exist via their modules.

### 4.4 Staff / Teacher Management — 🟡 Partial
- ✅ Profile, auto employee numbers, qualification/specialization, active status,
  assigned subjects/sections (`class_subjects`).
- ✅ **Staff attendance** (daily/bulk marking; present/absent/half-day/leave/
  holiday; late/early-out; monthly summary) and **leave management** (leave types
  + balances, request → approve/reject/cancel, approved leave auto-marks
  attendance, leave register/balance reports) — migration `0028`, `staff_
  attendance:*` / `leave:*` permissions, tenant-scoped + owner-scoped for staff.
- ✅ **Payroll-attendance summary** foundation (working/present/absent/half/paid+
  unpaid-leave/late per month) — ready for the Payroll module.
- ⬜ Timetable allocation, salary/payroll run, performance records.

### 4.5 Parent Portal — ✅ Built (Phase C, base)
Cookie-authenticated portal where a parent views **only their linked children**
(via the `guardians` table): child profile, attendance summary, timetable, fee
status and notices, with a child selector for multiple children. Homework and
teacher communication remain ⬜ (later Phase C).

### 4.6 Student Portal — ✅ Built (Phase C, base)
Cookie-authenticated portal where a student views **only their own** profile,
attendance summary, timetable, fee status and notices. Owner-scoping enforced
server-side. Homework/results detail and study materials remain ⬜.

### 4.7 Attendance — 🟡 Partial
- ✅ Student daily attendance: bulk upsert per section/date, per-section view,
  per-student history, statuses present/absent/late/excused, dashboard counts.
- ⬜ Staff attendance, monthly/yearly report exports, SMS/app absence
  notifications, period-wise attendance.

### 4.8 Fee Management — 🟡 Partial
- ✅ Fee structures (class/year, frequency), invoices with unique numbers,
  payments with **overpay guard**, status lifecycle, multiple methods, summary.
- ✅ **Payment receipt PDF** (owner-scoped download from the fee page + portal),
  on the shared pdfkit utility.
- ✅ **Online Fee Gateway** (`/online-payments`, `online_payments:*`): pluggable
  provider-agnostic hosted-checkout adapter (env-configured, no stored card data),
  payment orders with anti-tampering + duplicate-success guard, signature-verified
  idempotent webhook that credits the invoice + issues the receipt, refunds,
  per-institution feature flag, 5 reports + reconciliation, and graceful
  degradation (offline collection unaffected) when unconfigured.
- ✅ **Fee Management Depth** (`fee_categories:*`, `fee_schedules:*`, `fee_fines:*`,
  `fee_discounts:*`, `fee_reports:read`): fee **categories**; **term-wise schedules**
  (class/section/program/semester/student-targeted) with idempotent **invoice
  generation** + preview; **late fines** (fixed/per-day/percent + grace), visible
  in dues, **waiver** permission-gated; **discounts/scholarships** (apply →
  approve, audit of who applied/approved); and **dues reports** (class-/student-/
  category-wise, term collection, fine collection, discounts, outstanding,
  defaulters). amount_due stays the net payable so payments + the online gateway
  are unchanged.

### 4.9 Exam & Result Management — ✅ Built
- ✅ Exam creation, bulk mark entry (web **Exams & Results** page with a
  per-section/subject grid), per-exam results, per-student report.
- ✅ **Grade-band scale** setup, total/percentage/grade computation, **report-card
  PDF** (per student) and printable **mark-sheet PDF** (per section), generated
  with pdfkit from the exam results. Owner-scoped downloads (student→self,
  parent→linked child) + `report_cards:*` / `mark_sheets:export` permissions.
- ✅ **College GPA/CGPA foundation** — semester-tagged exams + credit-weighted
  grade points (`grade_bands.grade_point` × `program_subjects.credits`) compute
  a per-semester GPA and cumulative CGPA, exposed owner-scoped via
  `/college/students/:id/...`. ⬜ Subject-wise analytics screens.

### 4.10 Timetable Management — ✅ Built (Phase B)
Period & room masters, per-section timetable entries (subject/teacher/room per
day & period), class and teacher timetable views, CSV export, and **conflict
checking** that prevents teacher, room and section double-booking (enforced in
the service and by race-safe partial unique indexes). Tenant-scoped, with
`timetable:read|create|update|delete|export` permissions.

### 4.11 Homework / Assignment — ✅ Built (Phase C)
Teacher assigns homework to a section + subject (title, description, instructions,
due date, optional marks) with attachments; students view in the portal and
submit text and/or a file; teachers list submissions and review/grade
(reviewed/completed/late/resubmit + marks/remarks). Parents view their child's.
Attachments reuse the object-storage layer via a protected, owner-scoped download
route; assign/submit fire in-app + best-effort email/SMS/push notifications.
Tenant + owner scoped; `homework:read|create|update|delete|submit|review` permissions.

### 4.12 Communication — ✅ Built (base)
- ✅ Notice board / announcements with audience targeting and pinning.
- ✅ **In-app messaging** with per-recipient read/unread inbox, audience targeting
  (all students/parents, staff, class, section, individual student/parent/user),
  sent history + delivery (read) counts, and a staff console + portal/staff inbox.
- ✅ **Threaded messaging** (`threads:*`): conversation **threads** (one-to-one +
  group), replies, **per-participant read state** (unread counts + mark-read),
  participant-scoped access (same-institution validation; no cross-tenant/leakage),
  archive, best-effort reply notifications, and 4 messaging reports. Staff start
  threads (safe default); students/parents reply to threads they're in.
- ✅ **Email/SMS/FCM-push adapters** (all optional, degrade gracefully when
  unconfigured) + **device-token** registration; **fee reminders** (from invoices)
  and **absence alerts** (from attendance, de-duplicated per student/day).
  Tenant-scoped + owner-scoped; `communication:*` / `notifications:send` permissions.
- ⬜ Threaded 1:1 messaging and scheduled campaigns.

### 4.13 Library Management — ✅ Built (Phase D)
Catalogue (categories, book master with ISBN/author/publisher/edition/subject/
language/rack, per-copy tracking with status available/issued/lost/damaged/
retired), members (student/staff, college students included), issue/return/renew
with configurable loan period + borrowing limit, **auto late-fine** calculation
(per-day rate) that can be **waived** or **posted to a student invoice** (Fees
module). 6 reports (stock, issued, overdue, member history, lost/damaged, fines).
`library:*` permissions, tenant-scoped, with an owner-scoped portal history
endpoint (migration `0024`).

### 4.14 Transport Management — ✅ Built (Phase D)
Vehicle master (with insurance/fitness/permit expiry + capacity) and driver
master (license + expiry + helper); routes with assigned vehicle/driver; ordered
stops (pickup/drop times, zone, distance); student route/stop allocation
(school + college students). **Route- or stop-level fee mapping** with idempotent
**transport invoice generation** into the Fees module (stop fee overrides route
fee) and a transport-fee dues report. Daily **trip-log** foundation
(scheduled/completed/cancelled). 7 reports (route-/stop-wise students, vehicles,
drivers, fee dues, occupancy, document expiry). `transport:*` permissions,
tenant-scoped, with an owner-scoped portal allocation endpoint (migration `0025`).
Optional live tracking feed for the parent app remains ⬜.

### 4.15 Hostel Management — ✅ Built (Phase D)
Hostel master (type boys/girls/co-ed/staff, warden + contact), **blocks** and
**rooms** (floor, room type, capacity, status available/occupied/maintenance/
inactive). Student room/bed allocation (school + college) with **capacity
enforcement** + one-active-allocation/one-occupant-per-bed guards, plus **room
transfer** and **vacate** (status active/vacated/transferred). **Hostel- or
room-type-level fee mapping** with idempotent **invoice generation** into the
Fees module and a hostel-fee dues report. 6 reports (hostel students, room
allocation, occupancy/vacancy, fee dues, vacated history, maintenance rooms).
`hostel:*` permissions, tenant-scoped, with an owner-scoped portal allocation
endpoint (migration `0026`).

### 4.16 Inventory Management — ✅ Built (Phase D)
Item categories + item master (unit, opening/min/current stock, location), vendor
master (contact/GST/terms). **Purchases (stock-in)** with multi-line entry +
optional document attachment increase stock; **stock issues (stock-out)** to
department/staff/student/event decrease stock and **reject when insufficient**;
**stock adjustments** (damage/lost/correction, signed) with a negative guard.
`current_stock` is an authoritative running balance maintained transactionally
(row-locked), with a **stock-movements audit ledger** (one row per change, with
the resulting balance). 7 reports (stock register, low stock, purchases, issues,
vendor-wise purchases, item movement history, damaged/lost). `inventory:*`
permissions, tenant-scoped (migration `0027`).

### 4.17 Payroll Management — ✅ Built (Phase D)
Salary components (earnings/deductions, fixed or % of basic), per-staff salary
structures with **revision history**, and a monthly **payroll run** that pulls the
staff-attendance/leave summary to prorate pay (auto **unpaid-leave deduction**),
computing gross/deductions/net per staff. Runs are **idempotent per staff/month**
(recalc needs `payroll:update`) and can be **finalized/locked**. **Payslip PDFs**
(pdfkit: institution+logo, staff, month, earnings/deductions, attendance, net,
signature) are **owner-scoped** (staff download only their own). 6 reports
(payroll register, staff-wise salary, deductions, payslip status, attendance vs
payroll, unpaid-leave deductions). `payroll:*` permissions, tenant-scoped
(migration `0029`).

### 4.18 AI Features — 🟡 Partial
- ✅ AI **admin assistant** (GPT-4o) grounded in live school statistics, with
  conversation history persisted in MongoDB; degrades to 503 without a key.
- ⬜ AI report summaries, student-performance analysis, fee-pending summary,
  **attendance-risk alerts**, **embeddings document search**, workflow
  suggestions. *(All build on the existing AI service + a vector store.)*

### 4.19 Reports — 🟡 Partial
- ✅ Dashboard KPIs, fee summary, per-student exam report, attendance views.
- ✅ **Reports Center**: 10 cross-module reports (students, staff, attendance,
  fee collection, fee dues, exam results, homework, communication, documents,
  timetable) with filters and **CSV/PDF export + print**, permission-gated +
  tenant-scoped (`reports:center:*` + per-area read permissions).
- ✅ **Custom Report Builder** (`custom_reports:*`): saved + ad-hoc report
  definitions over the Reports Center registry — pick a source, choose columns,
  apply reusable filters/sort, then preview/run/export **CSV + PDF**. Definitions
  are **private or shared** (sharing is a separate permission) and a custom report
  **never widens access** (running/exporting re-checks the underlying report's own
  permission; tenant-scoped; students/parents blocked).
- ✅ **Scheduled Reports** (`scheduled_reports:*`): automate delivery of a saved
  Custom Report on a daily/weekly/monthly cadence (plus manual "run now"), to
  chosen recipients via in-app + best-effort email (CSV/PDF/both), with an audit
  **run history**. The underlying report's permission is always enforced and
  delivery is filtered to authorised recipients (no leakage); degrades gracefully
  when email is unconfigured; students/parents have no access.
- ✅ **Background Job Queue** (`jobs:*`, migration `0040`): a durable,
  Postgres-backed async queue + worker (no external broker) with atomic claiming
  (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), exponential-backoff retries, and permanent failure
  after max attempts. A **scheduler tick** enqueues due Scheduled Reports so they
  run **automatically** through the worker (manual runs still work). Handlers also
  cover fee-reminder / absence-alert sweeps. An admin/observability console
  (list/detail/retry/cancel/run-scheduler/process) is **tenant-scoped** (admins
  see their own jobs, super_admin platform-wide; other roles denied); payloads and
  errors never carry secrets. An optional in-process worker runs on a timer when
  `JOB_WORKER_ENABLED=true`. (See report list per module in
  [`MODULE_WORKFLOWS.md`](./MODULE_WORKFLOWS.md).)
- ✅ **Caching** (no migration): a per-instance **in-process TTL cache** for hot
  reads — the **dashboard stats** (tenant-scoped key, 30 s TTL, invalidated on
  student writes) and the super-admin **RBAC catalogue/matrix** (60 s TTL, dropped
  on grant/revoke). Keys always carry the `institution_id`; no secrets or
  per-request private data are cached; a role change never yields stale access (the
  runtime permission cache is invalidated too). **Cache metrics**
  (hits/misses/invalidations/entries) ride the existing `/observability` surface.
- ✅ **Scheduled Backup / Restore Automation** (`backup:*`, migration `0043`):
  super-admin database backups — **manual** trigger + **automatic schedule** (driven by
  the job worker, deduped per window) — as portable logical snapshots (no external
  `pg_dump`), stored in object storage / local-disk fallback with the raw path never
  exposed (protected, audited download). Durable metadata (scope, status, size, table/row
  counts, schema version). A guarded **restore** workflow: global-only, non-destructive
  **preview**, mandatory confirmation (+ `force` in production), transactional, and fully
  audited. **Retention** keeps the latest N backups (off by default → never deletes).
  Backup/restore **metrics** on `/observability`. (See
  [`MODULE_WORKFLOWS.md`](./MODULE_WORKFLOWS.md).)
- ✅ **Internationalization (i18n)** (web frontend): English (default) + **Tamil**, with a
  per-browser **language switcher** in the staff app, parent/student portal, and login
  screens. Client-side framework with clear translation keys, **English fallback** for any
  missing string (never crashes), and a structure ready for Hindi/other languages. Backend
  API stays English-stable; frontend maps its own fallback messages. Frontend gains a
  **vitest** suite (i18n core) wired into CI.
- ✅ **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA baseline)** (web frontend): a primitives-and-layouts pass
  so every page benefits — visible keyboard focus, reduced-motion support, skip-to-content
  links, labelled landmarks + `aria-current`, label↔control association with error a11y, an
  accessible modal (dialog role / `aria-modal` / Escape / focus-trap / restore), status/alert
  roles, and accessible names on icon buttons. Covered by jsdom + Testing Library component
  tests in CI.

### 4.20 Security — 🟡 Partial (see §6)
- ✅ JWT auth, role-based access, rate limiting, zod input validation, bcrypt
  password hashing, audit logs (Mongo), parameterized SQL, HTTPS-ready (nginx),
  **owner-scoped reads** (student role; parent pending its link).
- ⬜ Fine-grained **permission** layer (beyond role gates), secure **file
  uploads** to object storage, automated **backup** job, httpOnly-cookie token
  option.

## 5. Non-functional requirements (NFRs)

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Performance** | P95 API < 300 ms for list/detail at seed scale; pagination on all list endpoints (✅ pattern exists); ✅ **hot-path read cache** — a short-TTL in-process cache for the dashboard stats and super-admin RBAC catalogue/matrix, tenant-scoped keys, explicit invalidation on writes, with hit/miss/invalidation counters on `/observability`. |
| **Scalability** | Stateless API (horizontal scale behind nginx; the read cache is per-instance with short TTLs + explicit invalidation, so it stays correct across replicas — a shared cache (e.g. Redis) is a later option if needed); connection-pooled Postgres; multi-tenant data partitioning by `institution_id`. |
| **Availability** | `/health` + `/live` liveness ✅, `/ready` readiness probe ✅ (fails only on critical deps DB+migrations); target 99.5% on a single VPS; graceful degradation when Mongo/OpenAI/SMTP are down ✅. |
| **Backup & recovery** | ✅ Scheduled + manual **database backups** (portable logical snapshots to object storage, retention policy) and a guarded, audited **restore** workflow (super-admin only, confirmation + production force flag, non-destructive preview). Backup/restore success/failure + last-backup-time exposed as metrics. |
| **Security** | See §6. |
| **Usability** | Soft-3D premium UI, responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile), ≤3 clicks to core tasks, consistent search/filter/export/print. |
| **Accessibility** | ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA baseline: visible keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`), `prefers-reduced-motion` support, skip-to-content links, labelled `<nav>`/`<main>` landmarks + `aria-current`, label↔control association with `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`, accessible modal dialog (role/`aria-modal`/Escape/focus-trap/restore), status/alert roles for spinner/errors, accessible names on icon buttons — covered by jsdom component tests. Ongoing: per-page audits + automated axe checks. |
| **Internationalization** | ✅ Web frontend i18n — English (default) + **Tamil**, per-browser language switcher (staff, portal, login), English fallback for missing strings, designed for easy addition of Hindi/others; UTF-8 throughout. PDFs/reports structured for later translation. |
| **Observability** | ✅ **Structured JSON request logging** (correlation id via `x-request-id`, safe curated fields — no secrets); ✅ **Prometheus metrics** (`/observability/metrics`: requests/errors/durations, job + scheduled-report counters, queue depth); ✅ liveness/readiness probes; ✅ super-admin **overview + detailed health**; audit trail ✅; consistent error envelope ✅. (`observability:*`, super-admin only.) |
| **Maintainability** | Clean modular architecture (routes/schema/service ✅), TypeScript everywhere ✅, generated API docs ✅. |
| **Portability** | Dockerized; runs on any Docker host / Hostinger VPS ✅. |

## 6. Security requirements (detail)

All 11 requirements from the brief, with status:

1. **JWT authentication** ✅ — 15-min access tokens + rotating SHA-256-hashed refresh tokens.
2. **Role-based access control** ✅ — `authorize(...roles)` middleware on routes.
3. **Permission-based access** 🟡 — granular `permissions`/`role_permissions`
   with a `requirePermission` middleware and a seeded role matrix (migration
   `0012`, `GET /auth/permissions`); routes migrate to it incrementally (the
   users module is the first consumer).
4. **Rate limiting** ✅ — global API limiter + stricter login limiter.
5. **Input validation** ✅ — zod schemas on every request body/query.
6. **Password hashing** ✅ — bcrypt; all sessions revoked on password change.
7. **Audit logs** ✅ — mutating requests logged to MongoDB when connected.
8. **Secure file uploads** ✅ — S3-compatible object-storage adapter (local-disk
   fallback for dev), MIME+extension+size validation, safe generated names, and a
   protected owner-scoped download route (private storage keys never exposed).
9. **API validation** ✅ — schema validation + central error envelope.
10. **HTTPS/SSL ready** ✅ — nginx reverse proxy; certbot steps documented.
11. **Backup strategy** 🟡 — documented (nightly `pg_dump` off-box); automation ⬜.

Additional hardening tracked in [`DEVELOPER_HANDOVER.md`](./DEVELOPER_HANDOVER.md) §8
(owner-scoping reads, soft-delete students, restrict Swagger in prod, token
storage, sequence-based numbering, invoice `amount_paid` column).

## 7. AI features (architecture summary)

- **Assistant** ✅ — GPT-4o with a system prompt seeded by live KPIs (counts,
  dues, attendance), history in Mongo. Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/ai/assistant`.
- **Embeddings search** ✅ — OpenAI embeddings over document metadata, ranked by
  cosine similarity (computed on the fly, tenant-scoped, metadata only), with an
  automatic **keyword fallback** when embeddings are unconfigured. Endpoint:
  `GET /api/v1/ai-insights/search`.
- **Analytical summaries & risk alerts** ✅ — the **AI Insights** module
  (`/ai-insights`, `ai:*`): report/KPI summaries across 9 modules,
  **attendance-risk alerts** (low attendance over a window), **fee
  pending/collection risk** (overdue + outstanding, manual reminder only), and
  deterministic **workflow suggestions**. Metrics are computed deterministically
  and always returned; OpenAI only adds an optional narrative. AI usage is logged
  best-effort to Mongo. No auto-send, no cross-tenant access.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) §AI for data flow. Every AI feature is
**optional** and degrades gracefully when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is unset.

## 8. Assumptions, constraints, dependencies

- **Single-currency per institution** initially (₹ default); multi-currency later.
- **PostgreSQL is the system of record**; MongoDB is optional (audit + AI only).
- **OpenAI / SMTP / object storage / SMS** are external, optional integrations.
- **Hostinger VPS + Docker Compose** is the reference deployment target.
- Mobile app: **parent/student parity (Phase 1)** + **staff parity (Phase 2)**
  shipped — Phase 1 covers auth, dashboard, attendance, fees + online payment,
  homework view/submit, notices/inbox and PDF downloads; Phase 2 adds the staff
  experience (permission-gated hub: attendance marking, exam marks, homework
  create/review, communication, my timetable, reports, my payslips, and
  student/staff/fee-dues/TC quick views) — all over existing owner/tenant/
  permission-scoped APIs (no backend changes).

## 9. Success metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to record a full class's attendance | < 60 seconds |
| Time to issue an invoice + record payment | < 90 seconds |
| Admin onboarding (first useful action) | < 1 day, no training |
| API uptime | ≥ 99.5% |
| Critical security findings open | 0 before public portal launch |

**Clients:** Next.js web admin (login, dashboard, students, teachers, classes,
attendance, exams, fees, announcements, assistant, users) ✅; Flutter app
(dashboard, notices, profile) 🟡 unverified.

This snapshot is the **MVP baseline** the brief asked for. Everything in §4 marked
🟡/⬜ is the path from MVP → full ERP, sequenced in [`DEV_ROADMAP.md`](./DEV_ROADMAP.md).

## 11. Glossary

- **Institution / Tenant** — a school or college org; the multi-tenant boundary.
- **Branch / Campus** — a physical location under an institution.
- **Section** — a cohort within a class (e.g. 10-A).
- **Invoice** — a fee charge against a student; settled by one or more payments.
- **Audience** — targeting tag on announcements (all/teachers/students/parents/staff).
- **Owner-scoping** — restricting read results to the records a user owns
  (e.g. a parent sees only their child).
